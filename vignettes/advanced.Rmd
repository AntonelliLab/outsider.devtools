## Next steps

The best way to learn how to build your own module is to look at how others have
created modules for programs you are familiar with.


## Testing

After upload we can then test the functionality of the package from an
end-users' perspective by running `module_test`. This function tries installing
the package using the online repos, it then tries to import all the module
functions and running their examples.

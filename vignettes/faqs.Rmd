## Why is my module not returned by `outsider::module_search`?

`outsider::module_search` makes it easier for users to locate and install
modules. It can search for modules across both GitHub and GitLab (but not
BitBucket). For both services, the repo names must begin `om..` and there must
be an `om.yml` in the top-level directory.


Additionally, GitHub repos must have **"outsider-module"** at the beginning of
their repo descriptions.


Try comparing and contrasting your set-up with these repos:

* [Working example on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/DomBennett/om..hello.world)

## Can a module be an R package?

There is nothing preventing you develop an R package while enabling the
package to also act as an `outsider` module. You do not need to call the package
`om..`, all that is required is the `om.yml` and a functioning Dockerfile.

## How do I delete an old image?

Docker maintains images and containers. In the advanced vignette we showed you
how to stop and remove containers. To delete unwanted images:

```bash
# list images
docker image ls
# delete an image
docker image rm [IMAGE ID]
```

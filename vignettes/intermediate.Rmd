```

In [basics](https://antonellilab.github.io/outsider.devtools/articles/intermediate.html)
we introduced the essential elements that make up a module and then built a
super simple module.

On this page, we will build a module for a slightly more complex program while
introducing some more functionalities of `outsider`.

# Intermediate

## A more complex program




# Walkthrough

## Dockerfile


## R Functions


## Testing

After upload we can then test the functionality of the package from an
end-users' perspective by running `module_test`. This function tries installing
the package using the online repos, it then tries to import all the module
functions and running their examples.

## Next-up: [Advanced](/articles/advanced.html)

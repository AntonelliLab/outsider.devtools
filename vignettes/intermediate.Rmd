## Next steps and clean-up

**Testing**

After upload we can then test the functionality of the package from an end-users
perspective by running `.module_test`. This function tries installing the
package using the online repos, it then tries to import all the module functions
and running their examples.

**Tips**

The best way to learn how to build your own module is to look at how others have
created modules for programs you are familiar with. For more detailed written
information on building modules, see the [Advanced: Building a module](https://antonellilab.github.io/outsider/articles/advanced_build.html)
